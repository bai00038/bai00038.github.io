            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Bai Bing, and I've been working as a <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> designer for six years. Although I'm more of an
                introvert, I'm really passionate about design, and that has pushed me to constantly learn and take on
                new challenges. I joined this program because I want to expand my skills and explore new job
                opportunities, with the goal of growing both personally and professionally.</p>
            <p>Outside of work, I try to keep a balanced lifestyle by exercising regularly to stay fit. I also love
                reading, especially travel literature and novels, which really inspire me to explore different cultures.
                I'm also a big fan of trying new cuisines because I believe food is a great way to experience and
                understand different traditions.</p>
