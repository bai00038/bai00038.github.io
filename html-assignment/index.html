            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi, I'm Bai Bing, and I've been working as a UI designer for six years. Although I'm more of an introvert, I'm really passionate about design, and that has pushed me to constantly learn and take on new challenges. I joined this program because I want to expand my skills and explore new job opportunities, with the goal of growing both personally and professionally.</p>
            <p>Outside of work, I try to keep a balanced lifestyle by exercising regularly to stay fit. I also love reading, especially travel literature and novels, which really inspire me to explore different cultures. I'm also a big fan of trying new cuisines because I believe food is a great way to experience and understand different traditions.</p>
